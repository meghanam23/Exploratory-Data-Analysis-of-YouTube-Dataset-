**What is Exploratory Data Analysis?** 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), also known as Data Exploration, is a step in the Data Analysis Process, where a number of techniques are used to better understand the dataset being used.

**What we need to do generally?**
Extract important variables and leave behind useless variables
Identify outliers, missing values, human error etc.
Understand the relationship(s) between variables or find the lack of relationship(s)
Ultimately, maximize our insights of a dataset and minimize potential error that may occur later in the process

Exploratory Data Analysis perform two main things:
It helps clean up a dataset.
It gives us a better understanding of the variables and the relationships between them.

Components of EDA:
Understanding our variables
Cleaning our dataset
Analyzing relationships between variables
